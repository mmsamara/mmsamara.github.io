		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/SuitandTie.png">
		<p>I graduated from N.C State University with a bachelors degree in Economics along with a minor in Middle East studies (focusing on the Arabic language). Although I am making a change in my career path, my background in Economics gives me a unique perspective into the programming world, including a brief introduction to programming in my curriculum by using statistical software such as SAS and R to aid in economic research.</p>

		<p>I am currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill's bootcamp for full-stack web development. The curriculum includes HTML 5, bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js git, SQL, and Bootstrap. I am learning how to develop in an environment that is designed to simulate the workplace, and am enjoying the challenge that computer programming brings.</p>
